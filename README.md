# SushiFinderFrontend-ReactJS
Sushi Finder is the project which I'm working on currently which is a web app designed for all of the sushi lovers around USA. Any user will be able to visit the website and search any type of sushi he/she likes from nearby restaurants. The data will be 'falsy' and just for the demonstration purposes only. The frontend will be coded using ReactJS, Styled-components and much more advanced tech's.
